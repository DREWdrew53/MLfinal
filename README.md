![LSP-LR architecture](D:/PycharmProjects/MLfinal/Figures/LSP-LR%20architecture.png)
This repository contains the implementation of the LSP-LR model for efficient and accurate Image Quality Assessment. The LSP-LR model leverages ranking learning combined with score regression to evaluate the aesthetic attributes of AI-generated images (AIGI) without requiring text input. This approach improves computational efficiency while maintaining high performance in assessing image quality.

The model is trained on the Richhf 18k dataset, which includes human-annotated MOS (Mean Opinion Scores). By focusing on score prediction with fusion of learning to rank, the LSP-LR model outperforms existing methods like RAHF, demonstrating the potential of ranking learning for quality evaluation tasks.
